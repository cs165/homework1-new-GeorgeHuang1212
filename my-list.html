					Most successful football club in Germany
				</h1>
				<p>
					Bayern is historically the most successful team in German football, as they have won the most championships
					and the most cups. They are also Germany's most successful team in international competitions, having won
					eleven trophies. Bayern is one of only five clubs to have won all three major European competitions and also
					the last club to have won the three consecutive European Cup title in old straight knockout tournament format,
					entitling them to wear a multiple-winner badge during Champions League matches.

					The Allianz Arena is the home ground of Bayer Munich Football Club.	The external view is splendid, like a outer space ship. At night it has lights of different colours to give it an amazing scene. Normally it is in red which is Bayer Munich's home colour.

In fact, the top four teams continue to maintain their ranks from last year, with Barcelona, Manchester United, and Bayern Munich continuing to hold second, third and fourth place, respectively.
